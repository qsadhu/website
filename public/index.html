  <p>Welcome to <em>qSādhu</em>. \<br>
From childhood, the author has two primary interests Science and Gods.
With time, while he realized the significance of Physics
and accepted that those stories were just myths,
he also acknowledged the importance of those stories on his psyche.
This acceptance gave him a tool to understand societies and cultures.
At present, he works as a Research Scholar in the field of Physics,
studying quantum dynamics at ultrashort timescales.
But he also loves to talk about mythology,
politics, languages, finance, and broader anime culture.
He is a free software enthusiast and
has a strong opinion about modern technology.</p>
